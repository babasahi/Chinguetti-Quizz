        <h3>Geography of Mauritania</h3>
        <p>  Mauritania, a country in the western region of the continent of Africa, 
             is generally flat, its 1,030,700 square kilometres forming vast, arid plains broken
              by occasional ridges and clifflike outcroppings. Mauritania is the world’s largest 
              country lying entirely below an altitude of 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). It borders 
              the North Atlantic Ocean, between Senegal and Western Sahara, Mali and Algeria.
              It is considered part of both the Sahel and the Maghreb.A series of scarps face southwest, longitudinally bisecting these plains in the center of the country. The scarps also separate a series of sandstone plateaus, the highest of which is the Adrar Plateau, reaching an elevation of 500 metres or 1,640 feet. Spring-fed oases lie at the foot of some of the scarps. Isolated peaks, often rich in minerals, rise above the plateaus; the smaller peaks are called Guelbs and the larger ones Kedias. The concentric Guelb er Richat is a prominent feature of the north-central region. Kediet ej Jill, near the city of Zouîrât,
              has an elevation of 915 metres or 3,002 feet and is the highest peak. </p>

        <p>Tourism in Mauritania</p>
        <p>Chinguetti is 86 km from Atar, 90 km and 128 km from Ouadane, along the plateau track.
            Regarded as the 7th Holy City of Islam, Chinguetti was a religious centre and famous for its many Koranic schools and universities. The city also played a significant commercial role during the camel trading era.         
            The influence of Chinguetti largely exceeded the borders of current Mauritania, with scholars renowned as far as the Orient. Mauritania was once known as the "Bilad Chenguetti " – the Land of Chinguetti which reached its apogee during the 17th and 18th centuries.
            In the 1980s the town was shot up during an attack by Polisario guerrillas which contributed to Mauritania withdrawing from that conflict.
            Today the older south side of the town is partly ruined or buried under dunes, but it still offers an impressive spectacle to the visitor. Some old buildings, including the 13th-century mosque with its rectangular minaret still survive in the old city,
            The libraries or 'document repositories' of Chinguetti contain hundreds of invaluable and well preserved medieval manuscripts, detailing commercial transactions, aspects of Koranic law and scientific observations.</p>

        <h1>The economy of Mauritania</h1>

        <p>The economy of Mauritania is still largely based on agriculture and livestock, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into 
            the cities by recurring droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
            Train carrying iron ore Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore,which account for almost 50% of total exports.
            The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. With the current rise in metal prices, 
            gold and copper mining companies are opening mines in the interior.</p>
