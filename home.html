                is a sovereign state in Northwest Africa. It
                 is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, 
                 Western Sahara to the north and northwest, Algeria 
                 to the northeast, Mali to the east and southeast, and 
                 Senegal to the southwest. Mauritania is the eleventh 
                 largest country in Africa, and 90 percent of its territory
                  is situated in the Sahara. Most of its population of 4.4 
                  million lives in the temperate south of the country, with 
                  roughly one third concentrated in the capital and largest city, 
                  Nouakchott, located on the Atlantic coast.</p>

                            Based on traditional extractive industries (iron, gold, copper), agriculture and fishing,
                             the Mauritanian economy has undergone a movement of diversification. It has resulted in 
                             the exploitation of new resources (oil and gas), and the development of new sectors, 
                             such as telecommunications, which have experienced average annual growth of 26%
                              since 20011. Gross domestic product Mauritanian income reached US$5.124 billion 
                              in 20172. GDP per capita stands at $1,3003. The human development index was 0.513
                               in 20164 (157th out of 182 countries ranked) and a third of Mauritanians live below the
                                poverty line5. 40.3% of the active population is employed in the primary sector, 9.5% in
                                 industry and mining, and 50.2% in services (2016). In value terms, in the same year, the 
                                 contribution of agriculture to GDP was 27.4%, that of industry and mining 30%, and that
                                  of services 42.6%6. </p>

                   <h2 class="title">Ancient cities in Mauritania</h2>
                     <p  class="text">Chinguetti offers visitors an exceptional architectural setting thanks to the richness of its history. A true crossroads of the Arab world, Black Africa and the Moors, the city is thus known as the city of libraries because it welcomed many scholars who created Koranic universities there. It thus brings together about ten libraries which mainly contain works dealing with the Koran, religion, science or literature, some of which date from the 9th century! Its magnificent mosque erected in the 13th century is also an essential monument for any visitor. However, although classified as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, the advance of the desert is a permanent threat and could see the city disappear under the sand within forty years. </p>

                 <h2 class="title">Traditions in Mauritania</h2>
                 <p class="text">Mauritanian culture, due to the geographical position of Mauritania, 
                     is a mixture of Moorish (Arab-Berber) and black-sub-Saharan culture. For a long time,
                      Mauritania has been a place of convergence of various currents of civilizations, 
                      The empires (from Mali , Ghana, the Almoravids, etc.) who succeeded each other,
                       have made Mauritania a land of fertile exchanges and of ethnic and cultural mixing
                        as rich as it is varied. Historic towns such as Chinguetti, Ouadane, Tichitt and Oualata,
                         classified by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, are one of the visible expressions of this 
                         heritage and the diversity that have marked the history of Mauritania. The universities of 
                         the desert (traditional universities) and its libraries where several thousand unpublished 
                         manuscripts have wandered for centuries testify to the richness and originality of the 
                         Mauritanian cultural heritage. </p>
